    Within Cloud and Network Services at Capital One, we're always on the move, building and enabling infrastructure to help our engineers focus and create in the cloud. Drew operates in a critical role, leading multi-disciplinary teams executing on product strategy, developing, launching, and enhancing enterprise cloud products and services that protects and drive our business forward, with an emphasis within Cloud Behavioral Engineering.
    
    Cloud Behavioral Engineering is the discipline of understanding the current and past state of cloud infrastructure and services, defining specific measurements and scoring functions that encapsulate the vision of a “desired state,” orchestrating the transformations needed to achieve those states, creating alternate (virtual) versions of that reality moving forward that could potentially solve problems, and providing a platform where consumers and producers can interact and create additional value benefiting from the global knowledge and experience.
